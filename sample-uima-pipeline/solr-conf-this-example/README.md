This directory contains only configs, but no binaries. These configs are written so that one can index the output of a sample pipeline (accordingly they have all necessary fields). You can copy configs to an example Solr installation directory.  You can use the script StartSolr.sh to start Solr. It also creates a simple script StopSolr.sh that can be used to kill the Solr instance (note that there are better ways to stop/start Solr). More details on configuring Solr can be found in ../../solr-conf/README.md. Unike the main sample config, however, we do not use Hunspell here.
